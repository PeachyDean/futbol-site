                    <h2>Pedri</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pedro González López is a central midfielder for FC Barcelona. <br>Personally the most exciting 
                        young player in world football right now, yes I may be slightly biased.<br> However, the levels he performs at
                        considering his age is incredible. <br>The future of Barcelona and Spains midfield for many years to come.<br>
                        Future Ballon d'Or contender for sure in my humble, not owning a Spain shirt with Pedri on the back, opinion.

                    <h2>Gavi</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pablo Martín Páez Gavira, a midfielder/forward for FC Barcelona.<br>
                        Regular for Barcelona and Spain only a month after his 17th birthday.<br>
                        The levels of progression over the past year for Gavi is unbelievable.<br>
                        Having barely appeared at senior level at club and only capped at U18 for Spain,<br>
                        Gavi is showing high quality and does not look out of place at either level.

                <h2>Ansu Fati</h2>
                <p>
                    Anssumane Fati Vieira, a forward for FC Barcelona, yes, another Barcelona player.<br>
                    Born in Guinea-Bissau but luckily for Spain, moved to Seville when he was six years old.<br>
                    One of the most promising young attackers in world football with speed, dribbling and goals.<br>
                    Fati was on track to be a world star, even taking on the famous No.10 from Messi at Barcelona.<br>
                    Unfortunately, the past year and a half has been tough with severe injury and a struggle to,<br>
                    regain fitness, fingers crossed he can get back on that remarkable progression path soon.<br>

                <h2>Juan Miranda</h2>
                <p>
                    Juan Miranda González, a left-back for Real Betis, although did spend time with Barcelona too!<br>
                    Having made many appearances at every level from U16 to U23 for Spain, Miranda has already<br>
                    achieved his first cap and a debut goal for the senior national team.<br>
                    Whilst his progression for the national team has been steady and impressive,<br>
                    he is yet to establish himself as first choice left-back at Betis,<br>
                    but it feels like only a matter of time with the quality he possesses.
