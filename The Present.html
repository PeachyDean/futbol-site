    <p>The turn of the century provided a fresh chance for La Roja to become a powerhouse of international football. The country
        had been producing high quality players for a number of years now and the thought was that the steady growth had to pay
        off some time soon. The first four tournaments of the new century all ended with some measure of disappointment. The
        squad, whilst containing some very good players, felt like it was lacking a real indendity as the biggest nations all
        seemed to have big strengths within how they performed. 
    <br><br><br>
        After a successful qualifying stage for the 2008 European Championships, there was a buzz after the team had finally
        seemed to find a style and identity that they had seeked. They were now playing with short passes, heavy possession
        of the ball and good pressing without the ball in order to win it back quickly, what is known as tiki-taka.
        Spain were looking very impressive and won the group stage with relative ease. The team had a mix of experience in players
        like Carles Puyol, Carlos Marchena and Marcos Senna but had players like Xavi, Andres Iniesta, David Silva and Fernando
        Torres all of whom were entering their peak for club and country. Sneaking through the quarter finals against Italy via
        penalty shootout then finding themselves playing Russia once more and again easing to victory against the Russian side,
        the country had reached the final of the European Championships for the first time since their 2nd place finish in 1984.
        Meeting a Germany squad brimming with top stars in the final, Spain secured victory through a first half goal with 
        Fernando Torres scoring the only goal of the match. The dominance Spain had showed throughout the tournament was clear
        with David Villa finishing top scorer, Xavi Hernandez player of the tournament and a whopping 9 players included in the
        team of the tournament. Following the tournament, manager Luis Aragon√©s stepped down being replaced by Vincente del Bosque.
    <br><br><br>
        Between the 2008 Euros and the 2010 World Cup, Spain were busy breaking personal and international records, the biggest
        two being the new record of consecutive wins with 15 and tying Brazils record of 35 consecutive unbeaten. The 2010 World Cup
        was next up on the agenda for this thriving Spanish squad and whilst there were a few changes to the team with the introduction
        of Barcelona players Gerard Pique and Pedro and the most pivotal being Sergio Busquets in the midfield. The three Barcelona
        players Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets were at the absolute peak of their powers for club and were recognised as being the best
        midfield trio in world football at the time, making the Spanish midfield the strongest internationally. Whilst the scorelines
        of the games were low, the Spanish team faced a shocking start losing 1-0 to Switzerland after which they breezed to the
        final winning all their games by a 1 goal margin, largely with 1-0 results. Facing the Netherlands in the final, again the 
        game was tight and it took until extra time for Spain to finally break the deadlock with a goal scored by Iniesta.
    <br><br><br>
        Now being the holders of both of the major international trophies, Spain were looking to defend the European Championship
        and become the first team to win 3 major competitions in a row. Yet another flawless qualifying campaign and a fantastic
        start to the tournament progressing through a tough group with Italy, Republic of Ireland and Croatia. A quarter final
        clash with Franch ending in a 2-1 win to Spain which saw them cruise to the semi finals, where they found themselves up 
        against a Portugese side with Cristiano Ronaldo which proved to be a difficult tie. Neither side could break the other and
        the match ended in a penalty shoot-out win by Spain. The final was a rematch with Italy who held Spain to a draw in the group
        stage. This time around though, the Italians were not even close to a match for an absolutely dominant Spain side who put
        four goals past their opponents for a massive 4-0 final win. History was made.
    <br><br><br>
        La Roja were at an all time high and going in to the 2014 World Cup still felt as though they were going to be able to 
        retain the trophy. The mood was about to shift, the incredible form they had maintained during the previous 6 years,
        was about to take a turn for the worst. Struggles in the group stage which included a 5-1 thrashing dealt to them by 
        the Netherlands was a real embarassment for the players, the manager and the fans. Being knocked out in the group stages
        wasn't what the Spaniards had envisaged. Nor was the underperformance  in the following 2016 Euros finishing 2nd behind
        Croatia in the group stage and proceeding to be knocked out by Italy. As the champions of both tournaments, exiting at the
        stages that they did was an incredible disappointment. The following 2018 World Cup had a near perfect qualification stage
        and there was a brief glimpse of the sides rebuild, that was until bizzarely the manager Julien Lopetegui was sacked on
        the eve of the tournament. Spain and Real Madrid legend, Fernando Hierro, took charge of the team and after an eventful
        but not awful group stage, they came up against Russia, who were the hosts, in a game in which they were clear favourites.
        The failures of the last 2 tournaments crept back in as they couldn't break a 1-1 draw and were subsuquently knocked out
        via penalties.
    <br><br><br>
        An undefeated qualifying stage whilst winning the group for the 2020 European Championships, the Spain team had now began
        a process of a strong rebuild as the nation had long since had to try to replace the legends of the 2008-14 squad. The 
        new manager Luis Enrique put a lot of trust in younger players in order to progress the new generation of La Roja.
        After a delayed tournament start forcing the tournament to be played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the days of 
        the Spanish team being considered strong contenders to win, they were almost disgregarded by fans of the major 
        nations as a fairly weak side. Two poor draws with Sweden and Poland led to increasing criticism before a 5-0 win against
        Slovakia, which many thought was possibly a turning point in terms of how clinical the forwards were going to be. 
        An astonishing round of 16 game aginst Croatia which ended in a 5-3 win to Spain in extra time saw 10 goals scored in the
        last 2 matches, a positive to build on. A 1-1 draw with a competitive Switzerland side in the next round and yet another
        extra time, led to a penalty shoot-out which Spain won. Into the semi-finals when nobody really expected them to be.
        Yet another match ending in a 1-1 draw and yet another extra time leading to a penalty shoot-out which they could not win
        this time around. Small positives from a mixed competition, the main one of which being 18 year old Pedri, who was 
        incredibly influential in the midfield for Spain, being named as the young player of the tournament and included in the
        team of the tournament. The side came in for a tonne of critcism back home following the conclusion despite the low 
        expectations originally, the underperformance against the smaller nations like Poland and Sweden, coupled with the struggles
        infront of goal throughout the entire tournament were causes for concern.
