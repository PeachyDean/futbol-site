            <p>
            This is a fan page made by myself, Dean Conroy. I don't claim to be an expert in Spanish football history but I 
            do try to learn about bits of it. The inspiration for this specific site came from being a fan of both the Spain 
            national football team and also FC Barcelona over the past 14 years. </p>
            <p>
            I will try to keep the future stars page updated and possibly add more content to the site to discuss the nations
            tournament hopes or players that have risen up or fallen away. </p>
            <p>
            I do not claim to own any of the images displayed throughout the site as this is absolutely just a non-profit fan site.
            If any copyright owners of the imagery used would like it to be removed, please use the Contact Us page to let me know!</p>
