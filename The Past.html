<p>The origins of La Furia Roja, meaning The Red Fury, dates all the way back to 1920 when the country participated in it's first
    officially recognised international matches during the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp. Despite some issues within the event 
    surrounding other nations, the Spaniards managed to end up claiming silver medals. Unfortunately the country was unable
    to build on that and after came a long period of little progression and problematic events.
<br><br><br>
    Between 1934 and 1950, due to both World War II and the Spanish Civil War, the country were unable to compete in any
    competitive matches. They did however end up competing at the 1950 World Cup, which started out as a good tournament
    as the team came top in a group that contained England. Again the team couldn't manage to claim victory in the finals
    after crashing out in fourth place. What the natives did not expect however, was that this would be the countries best
    finish in the World Cup for another 60 years. 
<br><br><br>
    Despite Spains arguably biggest club Real Madrid CF being a complete dominant force in the latter part of the 1950s,
    it took until the 1964 European Championships, which they hosted, to be able to make a mark on European football as
    they were able to defeat an excellent Hungary side in the semi-finals and go on to defeat the Soviet Union in the 
    final of the tournament thanks to a late winner from Marcelino Martinez Cao.
<br><br><br>
    Then came a huge period of failure and decline from a country that had so much promise. Failing to qualify for 5 successive
    tournamnets, the 1968, 72 and 76 European Championships alongside the 1970 and 74 World Cups. The next tournaments that
    La Roja would succesfully qualify for were the 1978 World Cup and the 1980 European Championships, in both of which the
    teams struggles continued, being eliminated at the group stage in both.
<br><br><br>
    Spain would then become home to the 1982 World Cup which had the excitement of the nation at a high after their only previous
    international trophy coming in the 64 Euros, in which they were also the home nation. The highs of the 1964 tournament were 
    not replicated this time around as the team were knocked out early, leading to the sacking of the coach Jose Santamaria.
    There would be some small redemption for the squad as they performed well but unfortunately losing the final 2-0 to
    a French side captained by Michel Platini. This was the last time they would get beyond the quarter finals for a while.
